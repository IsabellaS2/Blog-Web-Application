- **Styling**: CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js

## Installation
Run `nodemon app.js`

## Features
1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.
2. Post Viewing: The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.
3. Post Update/Delete: Users should be edit and delete posts as needed.
4. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why did I decide to build it?
My motivation for building this project was to become more comfortable with using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. I wanted to experiment with routes and these langauges as I had recently learned them. This website allows users to create, view and update posts. It can be used as a personal notes section or blog or even private social media. This project taught me a lot about creating routes for different user actions and allowed me to become more comfortable with them.
