# Blog-Web-Application
The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application.


## Installation


## Features
1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.
2. Post Viewing: The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.
3. Post Update/Delete: Users should be edit and delete posts as needed.
4. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage
My motivation for building this project was to become more comfortable with using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. I wanted to experiment with routes and these langauges as I had recently learned them. This website allows users to create, view and update posts. It can be used as a personal notes section or blog or even private social media. This project taught me a lot about creating routes for different user actions and allowed me to become more comfortable with them.
